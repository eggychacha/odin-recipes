        <ol>
            <li>Place flour, milk, water, eggs, melted butter, and salt into a blender; blend until smooth and set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Gently fold in whipped cream.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or non-stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using approximately 2 tablespoons for each crepe. Tip and rotate the pan to spread batter as thinly as possible.
